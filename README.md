# selenium-js-project
Sort of a boilerplate for selenium js, Currently have it hooked to a shop account. 

#
1. Install packages 
2. set up env file according to what you need.
3. run jacobShop.js (thats where the cool stuff is). Automation of logging into scuffed web shop, insuring login, sends email.
